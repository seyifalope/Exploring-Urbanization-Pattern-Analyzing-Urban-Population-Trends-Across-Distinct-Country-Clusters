# Exploring Urbanization Pattern: Analyzing Urban Population Trends Across Distinct Country Clusters

Urbanization is a global trend that has significant implications for social, economic, and environmental dynamics. In this study, we analyze urban population (% of total population) trends in three countries from the three different clusters obtained in our analysis to gain insights into the patterns of urbanization. By examining the historical urban population data and applying statistical models, I aim to understand the growth trajectories and potential future scenarios for urban populations. The selected countries represent diverse clusters, allowing us to explore variations in urbanization patterns influenced by factors such as economic development among others

K-means Clustering was used to detect population growth patterns among countries using historical data. China, France, and Kenya were selected from each cluster of countries

Exponential and polynomial statistical techniques were utilized to fit models and to capture the underlying growth patterns and identify the most suitable model for each country.

Looking ahead to the projected years, the urban population percentages are expected to continue rising in all three countries. By 2030, France is predicted to 
reach 90.10%, China to 81.51%, and Kenya to 34.72%. In 2040, the urban population percentages are projected to further increase to 103.74% for France, 
106.49% for China, and 43.87% for Kenya. It is important to note that the values exceeding 100% in 2040 may indicate limitations in the model's long-term
